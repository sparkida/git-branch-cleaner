Removes all branches from repo up to a selected point in time


Safe Cleaning
-------------

It's recommended that you backup your working repo so as to be able to recover from any accidents or bugs that may take place, once deleted you will not be able to recover these branches.

```
$ tar czf <repo>.tar.gz <repo>
```


What if...
----------
"I deleted things accidentally" - hopefully you have a backup available
